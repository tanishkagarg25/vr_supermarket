# Title: Virtual Reality-Based Supermarket to Improve Daily-Living Skills of Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

# Introduction:
This project aims to develop a virtual reality-based supermarket to enhance the daily-living skills of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The project will utilize the immersive nature of virtual reality technology to create a safe and controlled environment for individuals with ASD to practice their daily-living skills.

# Objective:
The primary objective of the project is to create a virtual reality-based supermarket that will simulate real-world scenarios for individuals with ASD to practice their daily-living skills such as grocery shopping, money management, and social interactions. The project will also provide a platform for caregivers and therapists to monitor and evaluate the progress of individuals with ASD.

# Methodology:
The project will utilize the Unity game engine to create a virtual reality-based supermarket environment. The environment will be designed to simulate a real-world supermarket with various aisles, products, and checkout counters. The virtual reality environment will also include interactive elements such as shopping carts, checkout counters, and cash registers to provide a more realistic experience for individuals with ASD.

The project will also incorporate machine learning algorithms to personalize the virtual reality environment for individuals with ASD. The machine learning algorithms will analyze the behavior of individuals with ASD and adjust the virtual reality environment accordingly to provide a more effective training experience.

The project will involve collaboration with experts in the field of autism and occupational therapy to ensure that the virtual reality-based supermarket meets the specific needs of individuals with ASD.

# Outcome:
The project aims to provide a safe and controlled environment for individuals with ASD to practice their daily-living skills. The virtual reality-based supermarket will enable individuals with ASD to develop their skills in a stress-free and non-judgmental environment. The project will also provide a platform for caregivers and therapists to monitor and evaluate the progress of individuals with ASD.

# Conclusion:
The development of a virtual reality-based supermarket has the potential to significantly improve the daily-living skills of individuals with ASD. The project will provide a safe and controlled environment for individuals with ASD to practice their skills and develop their independence. The project has the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of individuals with ASD and their families.
